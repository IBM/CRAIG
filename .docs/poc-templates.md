# IBM Power Virtual Server Proof of Concept (PoC) Templates

Cloud Resource and Infrastructure-as-code Generator (CRAIG) enables users to effortlessly generate Terraform Deployable Architectures for customizable environments on IBM Cloud through its user-friendly GUI. It streamlines the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) process by configuring infrastructure with JSON, facilitating the creation of comprehensive VPC networks, managing security, VSI deployments, services, clusters, and IAM for IBM Cloud Accounts, with the added convenience of importing the configuration to quick-start environments or downloading it as Terraform code directly from the GUI.

Users can effortlessly configure PoC environments by uploading these templates to Schematics, enabling automated provisioning and facilitating internal testing. CRAIG simplifies the entire resource provisioning process, ensuring ease of use and efficiency.


## Cloud Resource and Infrastructure-as-code Generator (CRAIG) Setup 
CRAIG allows users to generate Terraform Deployable Architectures to create a fully customizable environment on IBM Cloud.

The PoC environments are customizable templates in CRAIG. See the [CRAIG getting started](./CRAIG-getting-started.md) documentation for more information on installing the CRAIG tool and general usage.
